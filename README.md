==========

You are to specify and construct HTML and PHP web-pages that support an easily-updated and customized "online shopping" capability for selling whatever kind of physical product your client wishes.

That will imply that you need to build a "Content Management System" (CMS) that your client can use to describe and catalogue the products that they have for sale. It should be possible use the CMS (and needing nothing else) to add new products at any time, to delete products, to record that additional stock of a product has come in, and so on. The CMS enters those details into a database.
