##Final Specification and rationale

###Shop

**View all products and browse by category:** Ability to view all products and organise them by category.

**Search products:** Ability to search for products (name, description, category) based on search terms, with partial word matching. Suggestions are shown based on product titles in compatible browsers. By implementing this, the customer will be more likely to find specific products.

**Sorting of products:** All multiple product views (all, category, search) can be sorted by name, price and stock level. Sorting of products allows customers to find what they are looking for quicker.

**Add to basket**: Items can be added to the basket from all product views and stock levels are checked on addition to avoid errors.

**Basket summary and basket page:** The first five items in the basket can be viewed in the basket summary. This is to allow customers to get a quick overview of thier basket without having to visit another page. Basket item quantities can be modified and are checked against stock levels to avoid errors. Checkout is integrated with the basket page for ease of use.

**Individual product pages and related items:** Each product has it's own product page and related items are shown at the bottom of the page. These pages allow the customer to see a full description of the product and related items might suggest a product they had not seen yet, which in turn would increase sales.

**Pagination:** Product views with multiple items are split up into seperate pages and can be navigated via the arrows (and numbered links) at the top of the page. By implementing this pages will load faster therefore making the experience better for the customer.

**Order tracking:** Customers can check if their order has been delivered using their order ID and email address. This reduces the amount of support email customers send, as they can confirm the status of thier order instantly.

**Out of stock message:** On selection of the 'out of stock' message, a user can input thier email address and be notified when the product is back in stock. This reassures the customer know that they will be able to buy the product and also reduces the risk of the customers looking for the product on another shop.

###CMS

**Add new product:** New products can be added including a product image. 

**Edit, delete and update stock:** Information about a product can be edited or deleted and new stock can be added to a product. This is implemented to make product management as easy as possible. 

**Summary of products:** This overview shows the user a simple overview of the products they have and which have low or high stock levels. This is to give the user an easy way to forsee problems with stock levels.

###Admin

**Popular products, monthly sales and average delivery time chart:** These charts show information on monthly sales (which the user can select) and the average delivery time based on the industry average. These give the user an easy-to-read overview of how the shop is doing.

**Order management:** The user can mark orders as delivered and view the details of those orders. This gives an overview of orders that have yet to be delivered.

**Low stock products:** This shows any products that have a stock level of less than 50. The user can edit or delete products from this view and it also allows them to see which products need reordering.

**Site/appearance settings and themes.:** These are the site-wide settings for the website. The user can modify the title, layout or product views and colours.
