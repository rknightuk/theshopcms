##Technical report

Since the initial report, the layout of the site has been modified slightly to accomodate for larger amounts of data being input into the database. The navigation has been moved to the left hand side, the general links are located in the top right and the search bar (which was overlooked initially) is top and center.

The CMS section of the project is partially complete, with only the “*add product*” feature currently working. The search functionality is fully complete. It searches the name, description and category of products and displays the results. If no results are return, an error message is displayed.

In terms of research and experiments towards the end product, the primary source was from the praticals and examples provided in WEBSCRP tutorials. These were invaluable in learning the core functions of PHP, Ajax and Javascript. I also followed examples and tutorials from a number of books as well as those offers on [Net Tuts +](http://net.tutsplus.com/). By working through these exercises, the features of the project such as search, were much easier to complete and also include cleaner and more efficient code than if the exercises had not been completed.
